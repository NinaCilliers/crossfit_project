# CrossFit data exploration and predictive modeling
This portfolio contains using the same data set from the CrossFit games:
<br>
1. A data-based approach to CrossFit training
   - Data is cleaned and explored.
   - Athlete demographic, lifestyle, and training habits are correlated with CrossFit performance
   - Age, gender, and BMI correlate with performance.
     <br>
2. Predicting CrossFit performance
   - Random tree, XGBoost, and a neural network model are used to predict CrossFit performance.
   - XGBoost outperformed all other models by ~3%.
   - Models were benchmarked against my predictive abilities.
   - A custom feature importance algorithm using feature permutation was developed for the XGBoost model.

Project 1 is located in the 'crossfit_eda' project branch and Project 2 is located in the 'crossfit_predict' branch.
